# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to review weather patterns in Oahu to determine if opening a combination surf and ice cream shop would be feasible. The primary investor is concerned, due to previous experience, that too much precipitation would make the business venture unsuccessful. We analyzed precipitation and temperatures over a year period and in the final project we focused on June and December.  

## Results
This table represents June’s temperature statistics.

This table represents December’s temperature statistics.

The key takeaways from these results:
-	The average temperature for the two months only varies by 4 degrees. This demonstrates that there is very little fluctuation in weather from summer to winter. 
-	The maximum temperatures are only two degrees apart. This helps confirm our previous assessment. 
-	The minimum temperature had a variance of 8 degrees showing December could be a bit colder than June. However, December did have a higher standard deviation so we would expect to see a bit more variance. 

## Summary
Reviewing all of the data tells us that the variance in weather from summer to winter is fairly low when compared to most climates. Winter does tend to get a bit colder but well above freezing and summer does tend to get a bit hotter but not significantly. Additional queries that could be run:
-	How does the precipitation vary between summer and winter? If the weather is already a bit colder in winter more precipitation could represent a double whammy in respect to driving down customer traffic. While not a deal breaker could be used to forecast staffing requirements.
-	Are the results consistent between stations? We could focus on several stations to see if we could get a more in depth look at our future location by focusing on the station that has the most results and/or is nearest to our desired area.
